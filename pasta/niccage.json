{"NOME_PASTA":"niccage","TEXTO":"Nic Cage is one of the best actors of his generation. I am not saying this to be ironic, he really is. The problem with The Cage is he got bit by the Hollywood bug and liked money. So his discretion in choosing roles diminished as his overhead grew.\n\nNow it is know in the film game that Nic Cage will take any role if you have the money. AND HE NEVER JUST PHONES IT IN!!\n\nLook at Bruce Willis, he is just coasting off his name recognition and collecting paychecks for some really weak performances in straight to VOD flicks that all have the same titles.\n\nNic Cage takes those roles and ACTS HIS ASS OFF! Its like watching a seasoned jazz pianist with juliard training take a gig playing the lobby of a cruiseship. You're like \"what the fuck, why am I hearing thirtieth notes fugue in a Britney Spears cover?\" The piano player is doing clever shit but the crowd is divided, some of them are fascinated and some are pissed off that \"Toxic\" is being played to the tune of \"the girl from impanena.\"\n\nSo you approach the piano player later when you see him at the bar and you find out that it is ACTUALLY NIC CAGE! He is preparing for a role in a movie called PIANO of FAUST. Where he plays a hitman who is killed in a double-cross and must atone for the sins of his old life when he is reincarnated as a Yamaha Keyboard used by a DJ that makes Drum and Bass music.\n\nYou say it sounds terrible but he just shrugs. And mumbles something about the script for Mandy."}
